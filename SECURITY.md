# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security updates are provided for the latest released version and the current `main` branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues privately.

Preferred method:

- Use GitHub Security Advisories: go to the repository, click "Security", then "Report a vulnerability".

If you cannot use GitHub Security Advisories:

- Open a GitHub issue and mark it clearly as a security report, or contact the repo owner via their GitHub profile.

We will acknowledge valid reports as soon as possible and aim to provide a fix or mitigation.

## Disclosure

Please do not publicly disclose security issues until a fix or mitigation is available.
